I'll probably tweak it to fit my needs, but it was the perfect start to what I was looking for.


Purpose
=======

Install drush / drush_make under the user for an SSH account.

Quick usage
===========

### Create a drush-init.sh locally

    cd ~
    vi drush-init.sh

Then paste the drush-init.sh script into that file.

### Make the script executable

    chmod +x drupal-init.sh

### Run the script

    ./drush-init.sh

### Remove files and make sure the script ran ok

    rm drush-init.sh
    ls -la ~/.drush

### Use drush

    drush

Thats it! You should see the commands (including drush_make) when you run just "drush" at the command line.
